# Sequence Sampling with IF-1

Sequence sampling is the task of different generating sequences that fold to the same structure.

Given a structure we might want to generate sequences that could have more favorable residues. 

The sequences can also be scored by the model, the scores are the conditional log-likelihoods conditioned on the structure.

### Run from Python
This tool can also easily be run from Python with BioLib üêç

### About IF-1

IF-1 is a model that stacks a transformer on top of the GVP (Geometric Vector Perceptron).

The model has been trained on 12 million structures where all but ~16k of them are predicted structures.

### Acknowledgements
The IF-1 model was built by a team at Meta AI led by Chloe Hsu.
